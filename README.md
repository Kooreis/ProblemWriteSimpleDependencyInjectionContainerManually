# Question: How do you write a simple dependency injection container manually? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code creates a simple dependency injection container. The container is implemented as a class named 'Container' with a constructor that initializes an empty object 'dependencies'. This object will be used to store the dependencies. The 'Container' class has two methods: 'register' and 'get'. The 'register' method takes a key and a value as arguments and adds them to the 'dependencies' object. The 'get' method retrieves a value from the 'dependencies' object using a key. If the key does not exist in the 'dependencies' object, it throws an error. An instance of the 'Container' class is created and used to register and retrieve dependencies. This approach allows for the manual creation of a dependency injection container, which can be used to manage dependencies in a JavaScript application.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall structure and logic. Both versions define a class that acts as a dependency injection container, with methods to register and retrieve dependencies. However, there are a few key differences due to TypeScript's static typing and additional language features:

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript version uses type annotations to specify the types of variables and function parameters. For example, the `register` method in the TypeScript version specifies that the `name` parameter should be a string and the `dependency` can be of any type.

2. Map Object: The TypeScript version uses a `Map` object to store dependencies, while the JavaScript version uses a plain object. The `Map` object provides better performance in scenarios involving frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs.

3. Class Definitions: The TypeScript version includes definitions for `ServiceA` and `ServiceB` classes, which are used to demonstrate the registration and resolution of dependencies. These classes are not present in the JavaScript version.

4. Type Casting: When resolving dependencies, the TypeScript version uses type casting to specify the expected type of the resolved dependency. This can help catch type-related errors at compile time.

5. Private Keyword: The TypeScript version uses the `private` keyword to make the `dependencies` property private to the `DependencyContainer` class. This means it can't be accessed directly from outside the class, which is not enforced in the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript version of the solution uses a simple object to store dependencies, where each dependency is a key-value pair. The `register` method is used to add a new dependency to the container, and the `get` method is used to retrieve a dependency from the container. If a dependency is not found in the container, an error is thrown.

The C++ version of the solution is more complex due to the nature of the language. It uses a `std::map` to store dependencies, where each dependency is a pair of a string (the service name) and a `std::function` object that returns a pointer to a `Service` object. The `RegisterService` method is a template method that adds a new service to the container, and the `Create` method is used to create and retrieve a service from the container.

The C++ version also includes a `Service` class and two subclasses `ServiceA` and `ServiceB`. These classes are used to demonstrate the creation and destruction of services, which is not present in the JavaScript version. The `Service` class is a base class that all services must inherit from, and the `ServiceA` and `ServiceB` classes are specific implementations of services.

In terms of language features, the C++ version uses templates, which are not available in JavaScript. Templates allow the `RegisterService` method to accept any class that inherits from `Service` as a parameter. The C++ version also uses the `new` and `delete` operators to create and destroy services, which is not necessary in JavaScript due to its automatic garbage collection.

In summary, while both versions solve the problem of creating a dependency injection container, the C++ version is more complex due to the language's features and the need to manually manage memory.
